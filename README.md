  Brent's Awesome List!
</h1>

<p align="center">
  This is my awesome list of awesome things for the awesome platforms that I use. It's like an organized, documented, and versioned bookmark list for software stuff that I'm interested in.

## Contents

### Theory

- [The Super Tiny Compiler](https://github.com/thejameskyle/the-super-tiny-compiler) All the major pieces of a common compiler in readable JS.

### Platforms:

- [Clojure](#clojure)
- [Java](#java)
- [Javascript](#javascript)
  - [Accessibility](#accessibility)
  - [React UI](#react-ui)
  - [Redux](#redux)

## Clojure

- [algo.generic](https://github.com/clojure/algo.generic) - Generic versions of commonly used functions, implemented as multimethods that can be implemented for any data type.
- [Nippy](https://github.com/ptaoussanis/nippy) - High-perf replacement for the reader.

## Java

- [Joda Time](https://github.com/JodaOrg/joda-time) - A nice time lib for Java, works well when used directly in Clojure.

## Javascript

### Accessibility

- [React-a11y](https://github.com/reactjs/react-a11y) - Identifies accessibility issues in your React.js elements at runtime.
- [ESLint jsx a11y plugin](https://github.com/evcohen/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) - Static AST checker for a11y rules on JSX elements.

### React UI

- [React file reader input](https://github.com/ngokevin/react-file-reader-input) - Easy to control styling, abstracts from file reading.
- [React-Media](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-media) - Match CSS media queries in components. Reacts to changes in screen size, etc.

### Redux

- [Redux-Saga](https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga) - Apparently easier handling of side effects in Redux apps.
